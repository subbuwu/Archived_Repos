# API - Fetching and Updating DOM
### A Basic JavaScript project that fetches data from an API using the fetch() method and dynamically updates the DOM by creating card-like elements using Promise methods.



# By following the steps outlined in this project, you will learn how to:
#### Fetch data from an API using the fetch() method.
#### Handle promises and asynchronous operations using .then() and async/await.
#### Create dynamic card-like elements in HTML using JavaScript.
#### Update the DOM with the fetched data to display the card-like elements.


# Installation

#### 1.) Clone the repository:
#### git clone https://github.com/your-username/project-name.git
#### 2.) Navigate to the project directory:
#### cd project-name

# Usage
#### 1.)Open the project directory in your preferred code editor.
#### 2.)Modify the JavaScript file (script.js) to suit your needs.
#### 3.)Update the API endpoint URL in the fetch() function with the appropriate API URL.
#### 4.)Customize the card-like element creation logic in the .then() method according to your requirements.
#### 5.)Open the HTML file (index.html) in a web browser to see the dynamically created card-like elements.
